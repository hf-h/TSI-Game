# TSI

A small terminal based shmup game. Very much a work in progress.

## Platforms

- Windows

## Build

To build the project you will need the msvc compiler "cl" and the c environment.
The easies way of doing this is to install the compiler via Visual Studio.

The environment can be loaded up using the x64 "Native Tools" command prompt provided with Visual Sudio or manually load up the vcvarsall.bat in a cmd instance

Once the environment is loaded run the build.bat file and it will produce the tsi.exe binary

## Running

Run the program from the command line.
Tested on cmd and the PowerShell version you can get in the ms store.
